# Mars Token (MTN) — Trading Bot Placeholder

At this time, the Mars Token team **does not operate or provide any trading bots** for on-chain activity, market-making, or automated interaction with the MTN token.

This folder is reserved for potential future tools, such as:

- Automated trading scripts
- Liquidity bots
- Community interaction tools

If and when any bot is developed, it will be used **only to support the growth and visibility of the Mars Token ecosystem** — such as:
- Creating stable market presence
- Improving on-chain volume
- Strengthening token listings and analytics visibility

Any future bot will be published here as **fully open-source**, with clear documentation and proof that it serves only the public interest of the Mars Token community.

This project will **never use bots for manipulation, unfair advantages, or closed systems**.

Until then, this folder is **inactive** and exists only as a placeholder.
