   --- Ownership Notice ---

   The contract still has an owner address, but it has **no control over trading,
   supply, fees, balances or liquidity**. Ownership is kept only for optional
   external utilities (such as NFTs or DeFi), and cannot affect the token itself.

   The access is limited to **minimum functionality**, and the token
   remains fully decentralized, transparent, and unrestricted.
