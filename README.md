The contract has **no blacklist, no whitelist, and no trading restrictions** — users can freely buy or sell at any time, in any amount.  
There are **no transfer limits, no cooldowns, and no time-based rules**.

**Contract ownership is preserved**, but it provides **no control** over trading, tokens, liquidity, or user balances.  
The contract is **locked from any modifications**, except for one specific purpose:  
**to allow the future addition of features such as NFTs, staking, or DeFi**, if the community decides to expand.  
**All other actions, including setting limits, taxes, freezing, or blocking addresses — are fully disabled and impossible.**

**No admin functions. No minting. No burning. No restrictions.**  
Mars Token is fully open, verifiable on-chain, and built for long-term trust and real decentralization.
