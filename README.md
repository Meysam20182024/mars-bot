## Smart Contract Design & Ownership

Mars Token is a fully verified and transparent contract deployed on the Base network.  
It is designed for maximum safety and decentralization — with no hidden risks or dangerous functions.

---

### Core Security Rules (All Active Now)

- **No Tax:** 0% buy and sell — friendly for traders and DEXs  
- **No Blacklist:** No address can be blocked  
- **No Whitelist:** No address restrictions or trading permission system  
- **No Limits:** No max wallet, no max transaction, no limit on buying or selling  
- **No Freezing:** Wallets cannot be paused or locked  
- **No Burn or Mint:** Supply is fixed — cannot be changed  
- **No Seizure:** No one can take tokens from your wallet  
- **No Trading Restrictions:** You can buy/sell anytime, any amount  
- **No Admin Functions:** Owner cannot change trading, supply, limits, or balances

---

### Ownership Status

The contract still has an owner address, but ownership has **no control** over the token itself.

- **Owner has no right to change supply** — total supply is fixed forever  
- **Owner has no right to block wallets** — trading is open to everyone  
- **Owner has no right to pause trading** — token is always active  
- **Owner has no right to edit fees or taxes** — taxes are 0% and cannot be changed  
- **Owner has no right to limit transactions** — no max wallet, no max tx  
- **Owner has no right to access balances** — your tokens are fully yours  
- **Owner has no right to interfere with transfers** — all transfers are final and unrestricted

Ownership is only kept for optional external features — such as:
- Adding NFT utilities  
- Enabling DeFi tools (staking, vaults, gamified systems)

These will be added through separate contracts — never by modifying the token.

All additions will be **transparent, optional**, and **cannot affect token supply or trading** in any way.

---

### What This Means for You

- You have 100% control over your wallet and tokens  
- Nobody can block, freeze, or limit your activity  
- The token contract is permanent — no changes can be made  
- Future tools like NFTs or DeFi may connect externally, but will never modify the token

**Mars Token is a trust-based, decentralized project — with real freedom and a clear, locked foundation.**
